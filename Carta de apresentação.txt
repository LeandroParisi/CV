My name is Leandro, I am 29 years old developer.
I currently have 3 year of experience in the area. I began my carrer as front end developer for small wordpress websites.
Then worked for 1 year at a Software house developing both front and back end systems using NodeJs, React and Typescript.
And I'm currently working at a brazilian finance company where I take part on a team which is building an online Exchange for crypto assets.

Questions:
Why are you the best candidate for this Opportunity?
I'm a fast learning developer, able to adapt to any language easily. With a solid knowledge of computer science.
I'm also eager to rise my career to international level, so I think it is an opportunity i'll be 100% committed to.
